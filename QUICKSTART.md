## ❓ Common Issues

**"Can't see cursor to click"**
→ Hold SHIFT+ALT in War Thunder (game feature)

**"Python not found"**
→ Install Python from python.org (check "Add to PATH")

**Overlay disappears**
→ War Thunder must be in WINDOWED mode, not fullscreen

**Can't click map**
→ Press F9 again to reconfigure corners

**Auto-detect doesn't work**
→ Use F10 for manual measurement instead

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Bigger map zoom = better accuracy
- Manual mode (F10) is more reliable
- You can move the overlay window anywhere
- Reconfigure corners (F9) if you change resolution
